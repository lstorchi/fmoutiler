== Notes about the main features of a protein preparation tool ==
=================================================================

Starting from PDB files, the protein preparation tool should:

1) Identify and eventually fill:
   a. the missing residues; *
   b. the missing side-chains.

2) Identify selenomethionine residues and replace them with methionine.

3) Delete all water molecules listed in PDB files or mantain only molecules within a certain distance from protein surface.

4) Add H atoms to residues/water molecules and define the protein termini (e.g. adding caps).

5) Optimization of H atoms.

6) Define the protontion state of side chains at pH=7 +/- x.

7) Final geometry optimization.


* This feature can be even discarded considering that, in order to have a nice starting structure when some residues miss,
   it is better to perfom an omology study with appropriate computational tecniques.


Additional notes:
Metal ions were not considered in the list above but some features to treat them should be considered.
